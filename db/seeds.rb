# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# User.create!([
#   {name: "Chance", email: "chance@gmail.com", phone_number: "8185230260"}, {name: "Carol", email: "carol@gmail.com", phone_number: "303043423"}, {name: "Gage", email: "gage@gmail.com", phone_number: "23423423"}])
